### Vulkan Vector Graphics

vvg is an nanovg backend using the vulkan api licensed under the __MIT License__.
It offers 2 interfaces:

- A high level interface that can be accessed from plain C99 and just provides the nanovg backend.
- A lower level interface written in C++14 that can be used for complex tasks.

The implementation itself is written in C++14 and uses the vpp library.
Currently vvg is in an pre-alpha state, but the first alpha is expected to be released soon.

Any contributions and ideas are appreciated.
