# FindVulkan
# ----------
#
# Try to find Vulkan
#
# IMPORTED Targets
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# This module defines :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` target ``Vulkan::Vulkan``, if
# Vulkan has been found.
#
# Result Variables
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# This module defines the following variables::
#
#   Vulkan_FOUND          - True if Vulkan was found
#   Vulkan_INCLUDE_DIRS   - include directories for Vulkan
#   Vulkan_LIBRARIES      - link against this library to use Vulkan
#
# The module will also define two cache variables::
#
#   Vulkan_INCLUDE_DIR    - the Vulkan include directory
#   Vulkan_LIBRARY        - the path to the Vulkan library
